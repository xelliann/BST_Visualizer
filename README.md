#Binary Search Tree Visualization and Interaction
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ and provides a web-based visualization and interaction interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The BST operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal are seamlessly integrated with a dynamic SVG-based visualization for a user-friendly experience.


Features
BST Operations: Insert, delete, and search nodes in the BST.
Visualization: Interactive SVG-based tree visualization using D3.js.
User Interface: Intuitive web interface for user interaction and feedback.
Console Feedback: Real-time feedback on operations (insertion success, deletion, not found).
Technologies Used
Backend: C++ for BST implementation.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6).
Visualization: D3.js for dynamic SVG rendering.
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code (C++), Web Browser (Frontend).
Setup and Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bst-visualization.git
cd bst-visualization
Open the Project:

Open bst.cpp in your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio).
Open index.html in a web browser for the frontend interface.
Run the Application:

Compile and run bst.cpp to start the C++ backend.
Interact with index.html in the web browser to perform BST operations.
Usage Examples
Insert Node:
Enter a value and click "Insert Node". Console feedback will confirm the insertion.
Delete Node:
Enter a value and click "Delete Node". Console feedback will confirm the deletion.
Search Node:
Enter a value and click "Search Node". Console feedback will indicate if the value was found or not.
